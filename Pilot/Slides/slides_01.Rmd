### What is SQL?

- SQL: Structured Query Language
  - Pronounced as either S.Q.L. (ess-cue-ell) or “sequel”

--

- SQL is a _query_ language rather than a programming language
  - Code is often less reproducible than programming languages because it's domain specific
  - Querying 

--

- Designed to manage data within Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs), e.g.
  - MSSQL
  - Oracle DB
  - MySQL/MariaDB
  - PostgreSQL

---

class: top, left, inverse
# SQL

### SQL Formatting

- Like other programming/query languages, SQL has reserved keywords/commands to perform instructional operations 
  - Generally, these keywords are written in all caps: `SELECT`
  - Most modern interpreters no longer require this, but it is the expected standard
  
--

- All statements/queries should be ended with a semicolon
  - A few SQL constructs (like common table expressions, we'll get to these later) require them, otherwise they are optional 
      - I'll almost certainly forget to use them
      - There's some debate on whether or not it's best practice

--

- In SQL, white space does not matter

## **Flavours**

## Data Modelling

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Flavours
-  RDBMs differ from one to the next. This is manifested in many ways:
    - different keywords 
      - e.g. return only 10 rows:
        `SELECT TOP 10...` vs `SELECT ... LIMIT 10`
    - different syntax
      - e.g. not equal: 
      `!=` or `<>` (or both)
    - other, more nuanced/complex differences
      - e.g. architecture, data types, etc

--

- We are using SQLite:
  - Super easy to get setup
  - Requires almost no overhead
  - Open source, _free_
  - Similar enough in syntax to learn on

# Data Modelling

### What are  Relational Database Management Systems?
-  Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs) are software designed to:
  - Store large amounts of data
  - Utilize a query language to allow easy retrieval of the data
  - Allow multiple users to access the data simultaneously
  - Manage permissions for data access
  - Mitigate data corruption and unauthorized access

--

- Generally, data is stored in a _database_
  - a database is a collection of information
  - within a database, a collection of objects (e.g. tabular data "tables") is stored

--

- RDBMs allow users to define interactions between these objects, such as:
  - Establish the relationship between objects 
  - Define procedural scripts to query specific data or trigger an action
  - Schedule routine work (e.g. procedures to run, maintenance, etc) 

---

# Data Modelling

### What is a Data Model?
- A data model is a notation for describing data or information

- Data models consist of:
  - Structure of the data
  - Operations 
  - Constraints on the data
  - Relationships

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Structure of Data

- SQL is comprised of tables

| Breed    | Affectionate w/ Family | Good w/ Other Dogs | Shedding | Coat Type | Coat Length | Playfulness | Energy |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Pugs     | 5                        | 4                    | 4              | Smooth    | Short       | 5                 | 3            |
| Akitas   | 3                        | 1                    | 3              | Double    | Medium      | 3                 | 4            |
| Samoyeds | 5                        | 3                    | 3              | Double    | Long        | 5                 | 4            |

--

- Tables have Attributes and Observations
  - In SQL we call Attributes "Columns"
      - e.g. Breed, Coat Type, Coat Length
  - and Observations "Rows"
      - e.g. Samoyed, Double, Long

--

- SQL databases require tables to be named
  - e.g. We can call this table "breed_traits"

# Data Modelling

### Structure of Data

- Columns are defined (and restricted, i.e. constrainted) by data types
- Common ones include:
  - `INT` (integers)
  - `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`, `REAL` (decimal)
  - `VARCHAR`, `NVARCHAR`, `TEXT` (text strings, with a maximum length associated)
  - `DATE`, `DATETIME`, `TIME` (dates and times)
- These may vary slightly by flavour (in SQLite they are simpler and less restricted)
- Data types are important:
  - they affect operation speed, storage size, data validity

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Constraints
- Data Models also specify constraints
- Constraints are rules that must be followed:
  - Referential-Integrity constraints
      - Ensure that values in one table have corresponding values in another table
  - Attribute Constraints
      - Ensure that certain types of values are always consistent within columns
      - May also ensure whether values are unique, not missing, etc


---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Relationships: Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
- ERDs are diagrams depicting the structure of tables within database
  - This both _identifies the tables_ and _describes their relationships_ 

--

- ERDs are useful for:
  - database design
  - debugging
  - writing logical, consistent, and efficient queries

--
  
- There three levels of details for ERD depictions:
  - Conceptual model
  - Logical model
  - Physical model

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Attributes of an ERD Entity
- For a given table:
  - Name
  - Relationship to another table
  - Column Names
  - Column Types
  - Primary Keys (if present)
  - Foreign Keys (if present)
  
--

### Attributes of a Relationship
- Defines which columns are related
- Defines what type of relationship exists:
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many


---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Conceptual Models
.pull-left.w35[
- Defines the tables (objects/entities) and their relationships
]

     height="400px";
     style="position:absolute; right:50px; top:250px;">
]     

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Data Modelling

### Logical Models
.pull-left.w60[
- Adds additional detail to the conceptual model by adding column names for each table
- Often indicates the type of relationship 
  - **One-to-One**: where a given row within a table is associated with only a single row in another table
      - Table 1: Country — Table 2: Capital City
  - **One-to-Many**: where a given row within a table can be referenced by multiple rows in another table
      - Table 1: Customer — Table 2: Customer Orders
  - **Many-to-Many**: where multiple rows within a table can be referenced by multiple rows in another table
      - Table 1: Employee — Table 2: Employee Type
      - A is a professor at DSI _and_ a TA at DSI. If a table contained Employee ID and Employee Type ID, A would be listed twice.
      - Even more of a many-to-many because A is part of two courses!

# Data Modelling

### Physical Models
.pull-left[
- Adds additional detail to the logical model by adding key type and column data type
  - **Primary Key (PK)**
      - Ensures each value in a column is unique within the table (e.g. an ID field)
      - One PK per table
      - Cannot be NULL
      - Ensures database integrity by restricting record deletion
  - **Foreign Key (FK)**
      - Creates a linkage between a column in one table and a column in another table
          - Generally, foreign keys are linked to primary keys
      - As many FKs as needed per table
      - May be NULL
      - Record can be deleted

## Introduction

## **First Three Commands**

---

class: middle, center, inverse
# First Three Commands

## SELECT

## FROM

## WHERE    

---

class: top, left, inverse
# First Three Commands
- Our first three commands (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) are essential to nearly every SQL query

--

- The template for our initial SQL statement is as such:

    `SELECT` : _the columns we want to retrieve_

    `FROM` : _the table we are querying_

    `WHERE` : _filters/conditions (optional)_

    `ORDER BY` : _column sorting: ascending_ `ASC` _or descending_ `DESC`_ (optional)_

    `LIMIT` : _how many rows we want to return (optional)_

---

class: top, left, inverse
# First Three Commands
- Always  specified in this order:
  - `SELECT` will come first
  - `FROM` will come after `SELECT`
      - when we are querying more than one table at a time, each will come after `FROM` but before `WHERE` (more on this later)
  - `WHERE` will come after `FROM` 
  - `ORDER BY` will come after `WHERE` clauses

--

- We'll sometimes use the `LIMIT` clause to look at data
  - This comes at the very end of a query
  - `LIMIT` shouldn't be used for analytics unless you have a specific reason
    - `ORDER BY` often impacts the usefulness of `LIMIT` 

--

- One more thing:
  - In SQL, we use two dashes `--` to comment out lines, rather than `#`
---


class: middle, center, inverse
# First Three Commands

## **SELECT**

## FROM

## WHERE

---

class: top, left, inverse
# SELECT

- At its simplest `SELECT` specifies column names we are retrieving
  - commas come between each column name
      - `SELECT student, course, grade ...`
  - column names with a space need to be enclosed in square brackets
      - `SELECT [poorly named column], better_column_name, AnotherColumnName`

--

- Within `SELECT` statements we can perform manipulations on columns
  - e.g. rename a column
      - `SELECT [poorly named column] AS better_col`
  - combine two text columns
  - perform math on a numeric column
  - ...and many more things

--

- We can use select to perform math without a FROM statement
  - `SELECT 1 + 1`
  - `SELECT 10*5, cos(2), pi()`

--

- When selecting columns, they need to exist in the table!

  
---


class: middle, center, inverse
# First Three Commands

## SELECT

## **FROM**

## WHERE

---

class: top, left, inverse
# FROM

- `FROM` statements indicate which table the data and where the table is located
  - in more complicated RDBMs, you will often have multiple databases on the same server and multiple schema within those databases
    - a fully qualified location of a table would thus be `database.schema.table`
- `SELECT * FROM table_name` indicates _everything_ in the table

--

- Best practice suggests that we should explicitly call each column, even if we want all of them
 - **Why do we think this is the case?**
---

class: top, left, inverse
# FROM

(`SELECT` & `FROM` live coding)
---

class: middle, center, inverse
# First Three Commands

## SELECT 

## FROM

## **WHERE**

---
class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

- `WHERE` clauses are conditions that the query will follow
- When we want to have multiple conditions, we use a single `WHERE` and then additional logical operations

```
    SELECT *
    FROM students
    WHERE first_name = 'Thomas'
    AND last_name = 'Rosenthal'
```

- **Notice we put string values in single quotes**
  - SQLite also allows double quotes, with a few minor caveats

--

- `WHERE` clauses always return rows evaluating to `TRUE`
  - Follows Boolean rules if more than one condition is present

--

- My favourite WHERE statement is `WHERE 1=1`
  - **Any guesses as to why?**
  
---

class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

### Logical Operators
- `AND`
- `OR`
- `NOT`
- `NOT IN`
- equals: `=`
- does not equal: `<>` `!=`  
  - (flavour dependent)
- greater than (equal to): `>` `>=` 
- less than (equal to)`<` `<=`
- `BETWEEN`
- `EXISTS`
  - table specific
- `IS`
  - `NULL` specific 
  
---

class: top, left, inverse
# WHERE

### NULL
- `NULL` is not a value (it's the absence of a value)
  - to check null values, we use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`
  - `= NULL` will not work

--

### LIKE
- `LIKE` allows for string wildcards
- `%` specifies the wildcard placement
  - `country_name LIKE 'and%'`
      - Andorra
  - `country_name LIKE '%and'`
      - Finland, Iceland ...more
  - `country_name LIKE '%and%'`
      - all of the above, _plus_ Antigua and Barbuda, Netherlands, Rwanda ...more!
  - `country_name LIKE '%an%d%'`
      - Canada ...surely more!
