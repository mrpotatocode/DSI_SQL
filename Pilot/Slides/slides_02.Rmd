# CASE
- `CASE` statements allow us to introduce conditional logic into our `SELECT` statements

--

- They are generally similar to `if` or `if else` statements in python, R, and other languages
  - When a condition is introduced, we check whether it evaluates to TRUE
      - If it is true, we proceed with a desired command, calculation, value, etc
      - If it is not true, we move to the next condition
          - If it is true, we proceed with another desired command, calculation, value, etc
              - ...all the way until we run out of conditions
  - For all FALSE conditions, we can use an `ELSE` statement if we want to

--

- The results of a `CASE` statement will be a new column
- Best practice is to name the new column using `AS new_column_name`

```
    CASE 
      WHEN [something is true]
        THEN [value or calculation]
      WHEN [something else is true]
        THEN [value or calcuation]
      ELSE [value or calcuation]
    END

---

class: top, left, inverse
# DISTINCT
- Not all query results will result in unique rows (i.e. duplicates are present)
  - **Can we think of why this is?**

--

- `DISTINCT` has two possible spots within a query:
  - One comes immediately after `SELECT`, before column names are specified
      - e.g. `SELECT DISTINCT songs, albums, artists...`
      - This `DISTINCT` will govern the entire query
      
  - The other comes within aggregation
      - e.g. `COUNT(DISTINCT products)`
      - This `DISTINCT` will only affect this specific aggregation

class: top, left, inverse
# JOIN

- Joins are used to combine data stored in different tables into a single table

--

- Joins are the Cartesian product of two tables with conditional selection of specific rows
  - A Cartesian product combines all possible row values with another 
    - An easy example is a deck of cards:
      
      combining four suits: 
      {♠, ♥, ♦, ♣} 
      
      with thirteen ranks:
      {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2}
      
      produces 52 cards (4 * 13)

--

- Joins require relationships (one exception, we'll get to later) between tables
- Different joins create different results
  - Join names specify which conditional selection is desired

--

- There are three join types in SQL but different joining criteria can further limit results 
- The most permitting join is a `FULL OUTER JOIN` and the least permitting is an `INNER JOIN`
  - Let's explore what this means by looking at each of them

# JOIN

### JOIN Syntax

Syntax for a join is as follows:

```
SELECT [columns]

FROM [left table]
	
JOIN [right table]
	
ON [left table.matching column] = [right table.matching column]
```

--

A couple of notes:

- You will need to specify which join type is desired:
  - e.g. `INNER JOIN`
- Matching columns do not need to have the same name, just the same value
  - e.g. `ON table1.LetterGrade = table2.Alphabet` will work because A=A, B=B, C=C, etc
- You can specify more than one column to be joined
  - e.g. `ON table1.FirstName = table2.FirstName AND table1.LastName = table2.LastName`

# INNER JOIN
- `INNER JOIN` filters both tables to rows present in both tables
- `INNER JOIN` does not produce `NULL` values
- `INNER JOIN` is the "default" join
  - i.e. queries do not need to specify "INNER", though it's good practice to write INNER

# INNER JOIN

A quick note on table aliasing:
- It is very common practice to alias table names 
  - It makes join criteria much more concise
  - It simplifies `SELECT` statements when column names are the same
    - This is a common error: _"ambiguous column name"_
      - SQL requires you to specify _which_ table you are returning the result from
- Generally, tables are aliased with the first letter (or first few letters) of the table so they can be easily referenced
  - `product AS p`
  - `product_category AS pc`

class: top, left, inverse
# LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
- `LEFT JOIN` filters the "right" table to rows present in the "left" table
- `LEFT JOIN` will most often produce `NULL` values
- The "OUTER" in `LEFT OUTER JOIN` is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded but both are correct
- LEFT _is not_ optional, there is no "OUTER JOIN"

- `RIGHT JOIN` filters the "left" table to rows present in the "right" table
- `RIGHT JOIN` will most often produce `NULL` values
- The "OUTER" in `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` is optional
  - Generally, OUTER seems to be excluded but both are correct
- `RIGHT JOIN` is somewhat frowned upon, but sometimes they make sense
  - Often your query can be reorganized to use a `LEFT JOIN` instead
    - SQLite does not currently support `RIGHT JOIN`

---

class: top, left, inverse
# FULL (OUTER) JOIN
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` does not filter either "left" or "right" table
- Expect `NULL` values to be produced from a `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- My experience has been to write `FULL OUTER JOIN` rather than `FULL JOIN` but this is personal preference
- Annoyingly, SQLite does not support `FULL OUTER JOIN` (_it really should_), but there is a work around to produce the results (we'll do it in Module 4)

--

# Filtering a FULL (OUTER) JOIN
- All OUTER JOIN syntax can be filtered to exclude the _matching_ criteria
  - Often called an ANTI JOIN, i.e. what's _not_ in the other table

```
    SELECT *
    FROM table_1
    {LEFT | RIGHT | FULL} OUTER JOIN table_2
    ON table_1.key = table_2.key
    WHERE {table_1.key IS NULL | table_2.key IS NULL | 
           table_1.key IS NULL OR table_2.key IS NULL}
```

# Multiple Table Joins
- More than one table can be joined at a time
- The order and type of joins will have significant effect on the final table
  - **Pause to imagine what these scenarios might look like based on your knowledge of different `JOIN` types**

# Multiple Table Joins


For example, let's combine these three tables:

.pull-left[

| FirstName  | Number |
|------------|--------|
| A          | 1      |
| Thomas     | 2      |
.center[<sup><sup>(_Table 1_)</sup></sup>]

| LastName  | Number |
|-----------|--------|
| Mahfouz   | 1      |
| Rosenthal | 2      |
.center[<sup><sup>(_Table 2_)</sup></sup>]

| FirstName  | LastName  | Symbol |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| A          | Smith     | !      |
| Edward     | Rosenthal | ?      |
.center[<sup><sup>(_Table 3_)</sup></sup>]
]

--

.pull-right[
If the desired outcome table is:

| FirstName | LastName  | Number | Symbol |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| A         | Mahfouz   | 1      | !      |
| Thomas    | Rosenthal | 2      | ?      |

# GROUP BY
- Aggregations generally require a *group*
- `GROUP BY` is mandatory any time a column aside from the one being aggregated is present

--

For example, a query wanting to know the number of days in each month:

```
    SELECT
    COUNT(days)
    ,months

    FROM calendar
    GROUP by months
```
--

- `GROUP BY` comes after a `WHERE` clause
- Remember: with all aggregation functions, values will be calculated _per group_

# COUNT
- `COUNT` performs counts of any given column or set of columns

--

- `COUNT(*)` provides a count of rows in a given table
  - no `GROUP BY` is required here

--

- Multiple counts are treated as separate columns
  - e.g. counting the number of days and months in a year
```
    SELECT
    COUNT(days)
    ,COUNT(months)
    ,years

    FROM calendar
    GROUP by years
```
--

- When `COUNT` is combined with `DISTINCT`, only unique values are counted

# SUM & AVG

### SUM
- `SUM` performs the sum total of any numeric column
  - Be wary, SQLite may be more permissive for columns with numbers; it's best practice to coerce (`CAST`) these values into numbers before summing to be certain of their validity
    - e.g. `CAST(SUM(column1) AS INTEGER) AS column1`
    
--

- SUM can accommodate multiple columns using the plus `+` operator
  - e.g. `SUM(column1 + column2)`

--

- Thinking about `SUM` and `COUNT` combined (i.e. a rolling total)? We'll get to that in the next session!

--

### AVG
- `AVG` performs the average of any numeric column
- Like `SUM`, it can accommodate multiple columns
  - we can also use other mathematical operations for `SUM` and `AVG`, like `-`,`*`,`/`, `%` (i.e. modulo, not percent), etc

- `MIN` takes the single minimum value of a given column; `MAX` takes the maximum
- Be wary of combining `MIN` & `MAX` with other aggregating functions like `SUM` or `AVG`
- **What do we think happens when `MIN` is performed on a string? Error? Something else? What about `MAX`?**

# Arithmetic

- SQL can perform many basic (and some complex) calculations
  - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, etc
  - geometric/trigonometric functions sin, cos, tan, degrees, radians, etc

--

- These calculations can also be combined inside aggregation functions
  - e.g. multiplication inside a SUM  `...SUM(quantity * cost)` would create a column like total_spent per group

--

- SQL is similar to other programming languages in its ability to handle floating point values
- **Because columns are type specific, how would we perform integer division on two numbers?**

- `HAVING` clauses come after `GROUP BY`, but before `ORDER BY`
- `HAVING` clauses only filter aggregated calculations
  - you can have both `WHERE` and `HAVING`
