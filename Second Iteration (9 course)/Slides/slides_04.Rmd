---

class: top, left, inverse
# Purpose
- Windowed Functions allow us to create groupings within groupings ("partitions")
- Allow for greater complexity than simple SQL 
  - In Module 3, we mentioned briefly a rolling total, e.g. a `SUM` and a `COUNT`; windowed functions allow us to return these types of results

<br>
--
  
- Often used with a subquery
  - One of the most common techniques is creating a row number `ROW_NUMBER()` per group
      - When combined with `ORDER BY`, the associated row number will be the _highest_ or _lowest_ per grouping
      - This allows you to select the min or max by setting the row number = 1 in the "outer" query (i.e. not the "inner" subquery)

## Other Windowed Functions

---

class: top, left, inverse
# OVER

- Syntax for windowed function always requires the `OVER` clause
  - `{desired_windowed_function} OVER (ORDER BY [a column])`
- The `ORDER BY` clause is required
- Think of the `OVER` clause as applying the function of your choice
  - e.g. create row numbers based on the ordering of this column
  - e.g. rank these values from highest to lowest

---

class: middle, center, inverse
# Windowed Functions

## Purpose

## OVER

## **PARTITION BY**

## ROW_NUMBER()

## Other Windowed Functions

---

class: top, left, inverse
# PARTITION BY

- Within an `OVER` clause, we can optionally use `PARTITION BY` to create groupings for the function to be applied to
  - `{desired_windowed_function} OVER (PARTITION BY [a column] ORDER BY [a column])`

- Now, the function is being applied to different groups 
  - e.g. rank these values from highest to lowest within these groups
      - The ranking will restart for each group
      - Think of this like the Olympics: the top three competitors for each event get gold, silver, and bronze — the `PARTITION BY` is the event, the `ORDER BY` is the time `ASC` or points `DESC` that determine the outcome of the event

--

- Both the `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` arguments can take more than one column
  - e.g. life expectancy by country by continent

---

class: top, left, inverse
# ROW_NUMBER()

- `ROW_NUMBER()` is the simplest windowed function, but also one of the most useful
  - There are no mathematical functions being applied, just an incremental value by group
  - Determining the top (or bottom) per group is often done through `ROW_NUMBER()`

<br>

## **Other Windowed Functions**

---

class: top, left, inverse
# Other Windowed Functions
- SQL supports quite a few other windowed functions
- `NTILE` for example will assign rows to buckets (4: quartile, 5: quintile, 10: decile, etc)
  - As such, the `NTILE` function requires an argument passed to it
      - `NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITON BY...ORDER BY...)`

--

- `LAG` and `LEAD` allow us to create an offset of another column
  - e.g. show a previous_year_total next to a current_year_total for easy comparison
- Knowing how and why to use these can make querying a lot easier

# LTRIM & RTRIM

- `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` serve two purposes in SQLite:
  - Their main function is to remove leading or trailing white spaces from strings
      - This is surprisingly common — many SQL databases are populated by human input, and this is a frequently overlooked input error
      - e.g. '    Thomas Rosenthal    '
  - Alternatively, they act similarly to `REPLACE` (coming up next), but within their specific context:
      - `LTRIM` removes any specified set of characters from the _left_
      - `RTRIM` removes any specified set of characters from the _right_
          - The usefulness of this is going to be very case specific:
              - e.g. wanting to remove a prefix/suffix of an ID: 
                  - `LTRIM("A189A", 'A')` would result in '189A'
                  - `RTRIM("A189A", 'A')` would result in 'A189'
                  - `REPLACE` would remove both A's: '189'

class: upper, left, inverse
# REPLACE
- `REPLACE` is likely going to be one of your most commonly used string manipulations
- It substitutes a character or set of characters with another
  - We specify which string (or set of strings within a column), what we want to replace, and the replacement value
      - e.g. `REPLACE('A is an excellent instructor','instructor','TA')` results in 'A is an excellent TA'
  - You can also replace a character with nothing, using an empty string: `''`
      - e.g. `REPLACE('colour','u','')` results in 'color'

--

- `REPLACE` statements can be strung together — the innermost function will be executed first
  - e.g. `REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE('A?lot-of,punctuation.','.',' '),',',' '),'-',' '),'?',' ')` results in 'A lot of punctuation'

# UPPER & LOWER
- `UPPER` forces all string characters to be uppercase
- `LOWER` forces all string characters to be lowercase
- Both `UPPER` and `LOWER` are essential for filtering tables based on strings
  - It's always best to assume that there is some string variety
  - Sometimes a `LIKE` statement will not be an option

# Concatenation (sometimes CONCAT, flavour dependent )

- String concatenation combines two or more columns into a single column
- Concatenation can handle non-column values too
  - e.g. `first_name || ' ' || last_name as full_name` 
  - Or  `last_name || ', ' || first_name AS full_name`
- In SQLite, `CONCAT` is replaced by two vertical bar characters: `||`
  - Most other flavours use `CONCAT`
- By default, spaces are not included between columns 
  - i.e. you need to add a blank space between quotes

# SUBSTR ("substring")
- `SUBSTR` specifies any section of a string to return, based on:
  - Which string (i.e. column)
  - Where to begin the section (i.e. the string position to start, as an integer)
  - The (optional) number of characters to return (i.e. how far to go, as an integer)

<br>
--

- `SUBSTR` replaces flavour specific functions like `LEFT` or `RIGHT`
  - By default `SUBSTR` counts from the left
      - e.g. `substr('a long string', 3, 4)` will return "long"
  - To count from the right, specify a negative number to start
      - e.g. `substr('a long string', -6, 6)` will return "string"

# INSTR (CHARINDEX flavour dependent)

- `INSTR` provides the starting position or location of a specified string
- `INSTR('The instructor is named Thomas','Thomas')` will result in 25, because "Thomas" is the 25th through 30th character in our string
  - `INSTR('ihe Instructor is named Thomas','Th')` will result in 1 because "Th" arises in "The" before "Thomas"

<br>
--

- `INSTR` can help with splitting a text string on delimiters
  - By finding the distance between delimiters and extracting the appropriate characters with `SUBSTR` we can move through delimiters in text columns
  - The code get's a wild quite quickly:

```
SELECT 
 SUBSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',0, INSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',',')) as FirstDelim
,SUBSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord', 
  INSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',',')+1,
  INSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',',')+1) as SecondDelim
,SUBSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',
  INSTR(
    (SUBSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',
    INSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',',')+1))
  ,',') + 
  INSTR('FirstWord, SecondWord, ThirdWord',',')+1) AS ThirdDelim

# LENGTH
- `LENGTH` returns the number of characters in a given string (or set of strings in a column)
  - `LENGTH` also works on integers 

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- tibble::tibble(CanadianMusicians = c('Neil Young','Leonard Cohen','Shania Twain','Michael Bublé'))
y <- tibble::tibble(CanadianMusicians = c('Neil','Leonard','Shania','Michael'))

```

- `LENGTH` is perhaps less of a string manipulation in and of itself, but is useful in debugging 
  - Combined with `MAX`, `LENGTH` can be useful, especially when adding string length constraints to a column
  - Combined with `SUBSTR`, `LENGTH` can cut strings within a column by a dynamic value

- **What happens when we apply `SELECT SUBSTR(CanadianMusicians, 0, LENGTH(CanadianMusicians)-6)` to the table below?**

# CHAR & UNICODE

### CHAR
- When provided an ASCII value, `CHAR` will return the appropriate character from the [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/)
  - e.g. `CHAR(98)` will result in 'b'
- Pronunciation is split on "char": 
    - "char" as in "_char_-broiled"
    - "char" as in "_car_" 
    - "char" as in "*char*acter"
    - "char" as in "_care_"

--

- `CHAR` is hugely useful with `REPLACE`
  - Occasionally, line breaks affect SQL column validity, so `REPLACE(lf_column,CHAR(10),'')` and/or `REPLACE(cr_column,CHAR(13),'')` will be hugely useful
      - Where `CHAR(10)` is a linefeed "lf" and `CHAR(13)` is a carriage return "cr"
- `CHAR` can help with structure and control of strings as they flow into columns

---

class: upper, left, inverse
# CHAR & UNICODE

### UNICODE (ASCII in some flavours)
- `UNICODE` provides the ASCII value of any given character
  - i.e. the opposite of `CHAR`
- The usage? I'm a bit unsure! Maybe faster than looking it up online?
  - e.g. `UNICODE('b')` will result in '98'

b <- tibble::tibble(austen_books = c('Pride & Prejudice','Persuasion'))
```

- Can use either SQL's or regex's Boolean operators
  - e.g. `WHERE austen_books REGEXP '(sion|ice)$'`
  - Or   `WHERE austen_books REGEXP 'sion$' OR book_title REGEXP 'ice$'`

# UNION & UNION ALL

- `UNION` and `UNION ALL` combine the results of two or more queries vertically (i.e. row-wise)
- `UNION ALL` keeps duplicate values, whereas `UNION` removes them
  - The difference between the two is one of the most common interview questions!

<br>
--

- `UNION` and `UNION ALL` require both/all queries to have the same number of columns 
  - You could `UNION` unrelated columns if you had a specific use-case for it
      - Column names will come from the first query
  - In situations where you don't have exactly the same columns, but still need to `UNION`, you can pass a `NULL` (or zero, or blank) column
      - Similarly, you can pass a string character to keep track of which data is associated to which query
  

```
  SELECT number_of_chips, number_of_tacos, 0 AS number_of_burritos, 'lunch' AS meal
  FROM lunch
  
  UNION
  
  SELECT NULL as number_of_chips, number_of_tacos, number_of_burritos, 'dinner' AS meal

  LEFT JOIN store2 s2 ON s1.costume = s2.costume
  
  UNION ALL

  SELECT s1.quantity, s2.costume, s2.quantity

# INTERSECT & EXCEPT

- Both `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` require both/all queries to have the same number of columns 

### INTERSECT
- `INTERSECT` returns data in common with both/all `SELECT` statements
- Values returned will be distinct
- **What's the difference between `INTERSECT` and `INNER JOIN`?**

--

### EXCEPT
- `EXCEPT` returns the opposite of an `INTERSECT`
  - for whatever rows are returned by the first `SELECT` statement, `EXCEPT` will return rows that were _not_ returned by the second `SELECT` statement
- The "direction" of `EXCEPT` matters a lot
  - `EXCEPT` is relative the the first `SELECT` statement, so changing which comes first will always change the results of the query

`INTERSECT` will find all products with work orders

Resulting in product_id's 1 & 4

] 

.pull-right[

`EXCEPT` will find all products _without_ work orders

```
SELECT product_id FROM product

SELECT product_id FROM orders
```

Resulting in product_id's 2 & 3

_OR_ all work orders _without_ products

```
SELECT product_id FROM orders
EXCEPT
SELECT product_id FROM product
```

Resulting in nothing (because no orders have a product_id that is not found in the product table)

# Assignment 2: Analytic or Machine Learning Model

**Q1)**
Create an analytic or machine learning model using our farmersmarket.db as the source of data.

For either, start with a question you want to answer. These are examples to get you thinking:

- Have sales for a vendor increased/decreased over time?
- Do some products sell better on rainy/snowy days?
- Will a customer who has purchased from a vendor return to that vendor and purchase again in the next 30 days?


**Q2)**
Produce some sort of graphic from your SQL dataset.

If you have no experience making graphics, keep it simple (e.g. count by a variable). SQLite can support this using the **Plot** window.

If you feel more adventurous, use a tool like ggplot (R), seaborn (python), etc. If you have access to Excel or Tableau or another BI platform, export a csv from SQL and build there.

Describe why you picked this graphic. What does it tell us about your dataset?

**Q3)**
Reflect: How can knowing SQL help you in your day-to-day work/life? Highlight a couple of different ways. This doesn't have to be strictly professional -- feel free to think about SQL in your personal life, if applicable.

# Assignment 2: Analytic or Machine Learning Model

If you choose to make an analytic model, imagine that I have just taken over the administration of the farmers market but don't know any SQL. What do I need to know to be a good administrator?
Focus on the following:

- Clean your data: e.g. if you have nulls, they should probably be coalesced.
- Include at least two tables (I'm not sure how you'd manage with fewer anyways). No one wants to remember IDs, so you should replace them.
- Include a performance metric associated with various time periods (e.g. years, quarters, etc).
- Discuss: Is the data model sufficient? Do we need other tables? Could we collect other data that might be helpful? If so, how would we gather this, and how would we store it (i.e. describe new tables in a logical or physical model)?
- Describe: How does your analytic model help me run the market? What insights can I gather from it?

# Assignment 2: Analytic or Machine Learning Model

If you choose to make an ML model, pick a simple algorithm. This assumes you have some comfort in R or python. There is no expectation that you produce a statistically significant or highly accurate model.
Focus on the following:

- Make at least one "feature" in SQL that serves your question (e.g. CASE statement, windowed function, etc).
- Include at least two tables in the query (I'm not sure how you'd manage with fewer anyways). IDs don't make for good features, so you should replace them.
- Report the accuracy or significance of your model.
- Discuss: How would you monitor this data? Can you collect "ground truth" data for your model? If yes, how would it flow back into SQL, and where would we store it (i.e. describe new tables in a logical or physical model)?
