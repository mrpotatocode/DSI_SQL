Prior to this, we've focused solely on retrieving values from tables:
- Tables can also be manipulated with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and/or `DELETE`
- _A word of warning...these commands are PERMANENT_ `r structure("\U1F631", class = "emoji")`
  - Generally, follow a policy that avoids altering data 
  - Make backups of tables before you run a query
  - Never hurts to test on a temporary table first!
  
- But they are useful, and sometimes the correct solution
- There is no `SELECT` statement for these types of queries

---

class: top, left, inverse
# INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

### INSERT
- `INSERT` allows you to add a record
- Specify where you want to add:
  - `INSERT INTO [some_table_name]`
- ...and what you want to add:
  - `VALUES(column_one_value, column_two_value)`

- `VALUES` come in the order of the columns within the tables
- `VALUES` must respect table constraints
  - e.g. NULLs, UNIQUE, data types, etc
  
- `INSERT` can help create small helper tables
  - **Can we think of any scenarios?**

---

class: top, left, inverse
# INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

### UPDATE
- `UPDATE` allows you to change a record
- Specify where you are making your change:
  - `UPDATE [some_table_name]`
- ...and what you want to change:
  - `SET column_one = value1, column_one = value2`
- _SPECIFY A_ `WHERE` _CONDITION_
  - `WHERE condition`

- You can change a single column, a few columns, all the columns, etc
  - (Respecting table constraints)

- **What happens if you don't specify a WHERE condition?**

---

class: top, left, inverse
# INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

### DELETE
- `DELETE` allows you to remove a record
- Specify where you want to delete:
  - `DELETE FROM [some_table_name]`
- _SPECIFY A_ `WHERE` _CONDITION_
  - `WHERE condition`

- **What happens if you don't specify a WHERE condition?!?**

- `DELETE` doesn't _remove_ a table from a database
  - Instead it removes the data from it, leaving the table structure and constraints in place

# Import & Export
- RDBMs allow data to flow into and out of them
  - Some processes are easy:
      - e.g. exporting a table as a CSV file
  - ...while others are complex
      - e.g. writing a CRM to a normalized data warehouse on a nightly basis

--

- In DB Browser for SQLite, we can make use of the following:
  - Import and export CSV files
  - Manipulate and export JSON files
- SQLite more broadly can:
  - Produce CSVs from queries (using the command line, which we won't do)
  - Connect to other programming languages

# CSV
- CSV stands for "Comma Separated Values"
- CSVs are file formats well designed to store SQL tables
  - The values of each row are separated by commas
      - Sometimes it makes more sense to use a "|" (pipe), if there is complex text data stored, which might be more sensitive to the presence of commas and/or line breaks

--

- They are a common file format for transporting structured data 
- CSVs can be opened by:
  - Excel
  - Simple text editors (e.g. notepad++, sublime)
  - Programming languages (e.g. python, R)


---

DB Browser for SQLite natively supports CSV importing and exporting for tables:

.center[

     height="300px";>
]

You can also export queries if they are stored in Temporary Tables

---

class: top, left, inverse
# CSV
DB Browser for SQLite allows us to extract a query result in a somewhat roundabout method:
- First, write a query
```
    SELECT * FROM product p
    JOIN product_category pc ON p.product_category_id = pc.product_category_id
```
--

- Second, right click the results, and select "Copy as SQL"

--

- Third, instantiate a table with `CREATE`
```
CREATE TABLE "example" ("product_id", "product_name", "product_size", 
"product_category_id", "product_qty_type", "product_category_name") ;
```
--

- Fourth, paste the results from your clipboard
```
INSERT INTO "example" ("product_id", "product_name", "product_size", 
"product_category_id", "product_qty_type", "product_category_name") 
VALUES ('1', 'Habanero Peppers - Organic', 'medium', '1', 'lbs', 'Fresh Fruits & Vegetables');
...etc for each row
```
- Finally, export the table to CSV

# JSON
- JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation"
- JSONs are file formats well designed to store tables, lists, arrays, and nested objects
  - Their syntax follows specific rules:
      - Data is in name/value pairs
      - Data is separated by columns
      - Curly brackets '{ }' hold objects
      - Square brackets '[ ]' hold arrays
  -  e.g. `{"first_name":"Thomas", "last_name":"Rosenthal"}`
  - or for tables: 
```
    [ {"first_name":"A", "last_name":"Mahfouz"}
        {"first_name":"Thomas", "last_name":"Rosenthal"} ]
```

--

- JSON can be opened by:
  - Web browsers
  - Simple text editors (e.g. notepad++, sublime)
  - Programming languages (e.g. python, R)
- SQLite also provides support for JSON value query and manipulation

---

# JSON

DB Browser for SQLite supports a lot of JSON functions:
  - Some are helper functions:
    - `JSON` and `JSON_VALID`, which confirm whether or not a string is JSON and/or in a valid JSON format
    - `JSON_TYPE`
      - When using extracting, type will help to inform column types that SQL will assume, based on the JSON

--

  - Other functions can be used for manipulation or extraction:
  - `JSON_EXTRACT` will allow you to return the values of a well-formed JSON string into desired parts
    - Importing JSON into SQL will use either `JSON_EXTRACT` or `JSON_EACH`
    - SQLite gives the following (fairly comprehensive) example set:
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$')` → '{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}'
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.c')` → '[4,5,{"f":7}]'
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.c[2]')` → '{"f":7}'
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.c[2].f')` → 7
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5],"f":7}','$.c','$.a')` → '[[4,5],2]'
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5],"f":7}','$.c[#-1]')` → 5
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x')` → NULL
        - `json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x', '$.a')` → '[null,2]'
        - `json_extract('{"a":"xyz"}', '$.a')` → 'xyz'
        - `json_extract('{"a":null}', '$.a')` → NULL

# JSON

Importing a JSON array (table) into SQL with DB Browser for SQLite requires a bit more of nuanced approach:
- First copy and paste your JSON table array into SQLite, and put it in a temp table:

```
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS temp.[new_json]
(col BLOB);

INSERT INTO temp.[new_json](col)
VALUES('[{"a": 7, "b": "string"}]')
```

--

- Second, use the `JSON_EACH` function as a table-valued function

```
SELECT key,value
FROM new_json,JSON_EACH(new_json.col, '$' )
```

--

- Third, use this previous query as a subquery and combine with `JSON_EXTRACT`, using the value column `JSON_EACH` generated

```
SELECT * ,
JSON_EXTRACT(value, '$.a') AS a,
JSON_EXTRACT(value, '$.b') AS b

FROM (...{subquery goes here}...)
```

--

- You now have a normal SQL table from a JSON array!

---

# JSON

DB Browser for SQLite natively supports JSON exporting for tables:

.center[ 
<img src="imgs/export_json.png"
     height="300px";>
]

--

This also works for Temporary Tables, so queries can be exported as well

#Purpose

- Databases often become more useful if they are _normalized_
  - When a table is normalized, it splits complex data stored in single columns and stores them instead in many smaller tables 
  - Our farmersmarket.db is normalized

<br>
--

- When a collection of databases is normalized we call this a data warehouse 
- There's a fine balance between the number of tables created and what is stored in any single table
  - The degree of normalization is based on criteria defined by "forms" 
  - e.g. our product table could be further normalized:
      - we could place product_qty_type into its own table and reference it with an id

---

## Third Normal Form

---

class: top, left, inverse
#First Normal Form

- First Normal Form (1NF) requires that each column contain one single value
- Many tables are in 1NF by default

--

Consider a non-normalized table: 

| name   | OS  | software                 | supervisor      |
|--------|-----|--------------------------|-----------------|
| A      | win | VSCode, MSSQL, RStudio   | Eric Yu         |
| Thomas | mac | Spyder, SQLite, RStudio  | Rohan Alexander |

--

We can shift it into 1NF by unpivoting the software column:

| name   | OS  | software | supervisor      |
|--------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| A      | win | VSCode   | Eric Yu         |
| A      | win | MSSQL    | Eric Yu         |
| A      | win | RStudio  | Eric Yu         |
| Thomas | mac | Spyder   | Rohan Alexander |
| Thomas | mac | SQLite   | Rohan Alexander |
| Thomas | mac | RStudio  | Rohan Alexander |

(SQLite doesn't support `UNPIVOT`, so we'll use `SUBSTR` and `UNION` to create this)

## Third Normal Form

---

class: top, left, inverse
#Second Normal Form

- Second Normal Form (2NF) requires that each non-key column is dependent on the primary key
  - Therefore, no row deletions can affect the integrity of another table
- Our farmersmarket.db is 2NF!

--

Our table is currently 1NF, which is required for 2NF:

| name   | OS  | software | supervisor      |
|--------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| A      | win | VSCode   | Eric Yu         |
| A      | win | MSSQL    | Eric Yu         |
| A      | win | RStudio  | Eric Yu         |
| Thomas | mac | Spyder   | Rohan Alexander |
| Thomas | mac | SQLite   | Rohan Alexander |
| Thomas | mac | RStudio  | Rohan Alexander |

---

class: top, left, inverse
#Second Normal Form

2NF requires that we prevent supervisors from being deleted, should A or myself leave the school. 

Supervisors now becomes its own table:

| id | name            |
|----|-----------------|
| 1  | Eric Yu         |
| 2  | Rohan Alexander |

---

class: top, left, inverse
#Second Normal Form

We introduce a PK id and supervisor_id becomes our FK, replacing supervisor:

| id | name   | OS  | supervisor_id |
|----|--------|-----|---------------|
| 1  | A      | win | 1             |
| 2  | Thomas | mac | 2             |

...and student_software now references that PK:

| id | software |
|----|----------|
| 1  | VSCode   |
| 1  | MSSQL    |
| 1  | RStudio  |
| 2  | Spyder   |
| 2  | SQLite   |
| 2  | RStudio  |

## Purpose

## Second Normal Form

## **Third Normal Form**

---

class: top, left, inverse
#Third Normal Form

- Third Normal Form (3NF) requires that we replace any non-key transitive functional dependency 
  - This means if any non-key column's value changed, and therefore another non-key value would be invalidated, we must replace this dependency with a table relationship instead

--

Our table is currently 2NF, which is required for 3NF:

| id | name   | OS  | supervisor_id |
|----|--------|-----|---------------|
| 1  | A      | win | 1             |
| 2  | Thomas | mac | 2             |


---

class: top, left, inverse
#Third Normal Form

Because MSSQL is only available on Windows, any change in OS will change whether MSSQL can be installed

OS must become its own table:

| OS_id | OS   | win_only |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1     | win  | TRUE     |
| 2     | mac  | FALSE    |

...and we must create a software table referencing it

| software_id | software | win_only | 
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 1           | MSSQL    | TRUE     |
| 2           | RStudio  | FALSE    |
| 3           | VSCode   | FALSE    |
| 4           | SQLite   | FALSE    | 
| 5           | Spyder   | FALSE    |

---

class: top, left, inverse
#Third Normal Form

At last, we have 3NF, for both our student_software table:

| id | OS_id | software_id |
|----|-------|-------------|
| 1  | 1     | 1           |
| 1  | 1     | 2           |
| 1  | 1     | 3           | 
| 2  | 2     | 2           |
| 2  | 2     | 4           | 
| 2  | 2     | 5           |

...and our original table:

| id | name   | OS_id | supervisor_id |
|----|--------|-------|---------------|
| 1  | A      | 1     | 1             |
| 2  | Thomas | 2     | 2             |

# Views

- Views instantiate a query result permanently
- They are particularly useful in highly normalized databases, where reproducing a query is tiresome or prone to query errors

<br>
--

- In databases that have live data flowing in:
  - Tables that are created from queries need to be continuously updated whenever there is new data
      - This requires either downtime where the table is empty
      - Or the chance of a "dirty read" (where a table is read before the data is fully updated)
  - Views, on the other hand, will always show the most up-to-date values!

<br>

- Views are created just like tables:
